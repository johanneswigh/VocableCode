# VocableCode

Year of production: 2017-

Medium: Customized software, web browser

# Description

Vocable Code is manifested as a feminist coding workshop primarily for women, queers, LGBT and non-binaries who are interested in programming but no prior knowledge is needed. The workshop addresses computer code as language that is design for both human and machine reading. While participants will base on the artwork 'Vocable Code' to learn basic coding concepts, they will also explore code as expressive and aesthetic materials, such as computer code as poetic text that is performative and executable. Through thinking and discussing about code and (non)binary logics, participants will incoporate textual materials, visual effects and audio elements/recording voices to produce their own algorithmic vocable code (in the form of both software and webpages) that addresses the border theme of feminism.

# Technical

[p5js](https://p5js.org/) is an open source Javascript library developed by the Processing Foundation and is founded by [Lauran McCarthy](http://lauren-mccarthy.com/) to make coding more accessible to artists, designers, educators and beginners. I share the vision and goal of p5.js, which is to put community outreach and diversity as priority. 

Material requires: 
- a recorder
- Audacity for audio editing 
- Code editor
- p5js libaries
- If run on a local browser, it is required a [local server](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/wiki/Local-server). Or you may need a firefox browser to get things up and running. 

# Background

Informed by constrained writing, experimental writing of codeworks (Raley, 2002) as well as the publication of Anomalous Press issue 11 on ‘Queerness’ (2014) and Geoff Cox’s writing on 'Speaking Code' (2013), the artwork ‘Vocable code’ explores the notion of queerness through computational thinking, the reading, writing, speaking and thinking with code and language. It is a piece of visual-audio software or electronic literature or web art or a digital poetry that contains different voices and visual interpretation of queerness.

# Process

The work collects statements and voices from participants with certain given constraints:

- Writing
1. Continue the sent4nece with the starting words "Queer is..."
2. Each sentence contains no more than 5 words (the starting word, queer, is not included).
3. More than 1 sentence is allowed but not more than 3.
4. English word/sentence is required.
5. It is ok to have just one word.

- Speaking
1. It is up to the participant to decide the temporality and rhythm of speaking the text
2. It is up to the participant to either speak the full word, full sentence with different pitch/tempo/rhythm. They can also speak a certain part (phonetics) of the word/sentence. In other words, the word or sentence doesn't need to be completed.

# Create your own vocable code

1. Declare your work with the open sourcelicience (state explict in your source code) that allows sharing and modifying the code
2. Think of a theme that you want to explore e.g "Queer is", "non-binary is"
3. Set up your own constraints, both in terms of writing and speaking.
4. Ask your friends to take part and allow you to record their voice (I use Android device with the voice recording apps called 'voice recorder') 
5. Download the source code from Github
6. Modify the code, have your own voice files and the json file
7. Run on a browser and test it
8. Upload your code to a public domain and allow people to share your code

* Ping me for your vocable code :)
